=====================

This project fufills the following requirements: 

Requirements
Create a static HTML page. You may use whatever content you like as long as you have:
=====================================================================================
A navigation bar at the top of the page. This must include at least 5 navigation links.
3 paragraphs of main content
Include at least 1 large sized image 
Include a gallery of at least 4 smaller images

Add css so that:
================
The navigation bar and main content are centered on the page and are never wider than 960px
The links in the main navigation should be inline (side-by-side)
The gallery of images should also be inline
The large-format image should never be larger than its container

Make it responsive!
===================
At sub-960px width, the navigation bar and main content should scale so that it never extends past the browser edge
At sub-960px width, the navigation bar and main content should be padded away from the edge of the browser (10-20px on either side)
At the proper point (when items start to stack), collapse the main navigation so the items are now full width and stack vertically
At the proper point (when items start to stack), collapse the image gallery so the items are now full width and stack vertically
